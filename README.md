# Client-Server Chat (NIO2)

The engine of the program (Client and Server) is written using NIO2 lib. GUI is written in obsolete Swing technology. To 
run the program, you must first start the Server, and only then start the Client. The Server runs on the localhost, due 
to the lack of a static IP address. While only sends the text in English. It was tested in the environment of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
